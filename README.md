## **Data Preprocessing**
* **Checked for missing values:  No missing data was found.**
* **Detecting and removing Outlier (Weight in gms).**
* **Converted categorical features to numerical using encoding (Label encoding for Gender, Warehouse Block, Product Importance, Mode of shipment).**
* **Normalized Numerical features (Cost of the Product, Discount Offered, Weight in gms, Customer care call, Customer Ratings).**
* **Split data into training (75%) and testing (25%) sets for model building.** 

## **Exploratory Data Analysis**

## **Key Findings**
### **Gender Distribution**
* **The dataset has the equal number of both males and female customers, with percentage of 49.6% and 50.4% respectively.**
### **Product Insights**
* **Heavier products (4000-6000 gms) are more likely delivered on time.**
* **Products costing approximately $300 are mostly delivered on time compared to low-cost items.**
### **Customer Behaviour**
* **High customer care calls often indicate delayed delivery.**
* **Repeat customers have better delivery outcomes.**
### **Discount Impact**
* **Minimal discounts (0-10%) correlate with timely deliveries.** 
* **Higher discounts (>10%) lead to more late deliveries.**

## **Machine Learning Models**
All models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust performance comparison.

### **Logistic Regression**
* **Interpreted linear relationships between features (Accuracy - 64%).**
### **Decision Tree Classifier**
* **Selected optimal parameters via grid search (Accuracy - 67%).**
* **Grid Search in Decision Tree: Accuracy - 68%.**
* **Max depth:4, minimum samples leaf: 1, minimum samples split: 2.**
### **Random Forest Classifier**
* **Explored ensemble learning for improved accuracy (Accuracy - 67%).**
* **Max depth:4, minimum samples leaf: 2, minimum samples split: 2.**
* **Grid search in random forest: Accuracy - 68%.**
### **K-Nearest Neighbors**
* **Examined proximity-based decision-making (Accuracy - 65%).**

## **Recommendations**
To improve on-time delivery rates and customer satisfaction, the company should:

* **Optimize shipment mode selection based on delivery reliability.**
* **Proactively address shipments issues with multiple customer care calls.**
* **Use customer ratings to identify and fix recurring delivery issues.**
* **Prioritize high-importance and high-discount shipments for timely handling.**
* **Regularly analyse warehouse and route performance for targeted improvements.**
* **Implement predictive analytics to identify and intervene in at-risk shipments.**

## **Conclusion**
* **The project's objective was to forecast on-time delivery for an e-commerce company's products and to explore factors influencing delivery times and customer behaviour.**
* **The exploratory analysis highlighted that product weight and cost are crucial to delivery success, with products in the 4000-6000 gms range and priced approximately $300 being more likely to arrive on time. A significant volume of products was dispatched from warehouse F using shipping, suggesting its proximity to a seaport.**
* **Customer behaviour also sheds light on delivery outcomes. An increase in customer care calls often correlates with delivery delays.**
* **In contrast, customers with a history of multiple purchases tend to experience more punctual deliveries, which might explain their repeat business.**
* **Products with discounts ranging from 0-10% tend to arrive on time. Meanwhile, products with discounts above 10% are more likely to not arrive on time.**
